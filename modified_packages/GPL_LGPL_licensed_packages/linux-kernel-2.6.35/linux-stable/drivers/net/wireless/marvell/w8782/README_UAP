4) SOFT_RESET command
   This command is used to perform a "soft reset" on the module. 
   The FW code will disable hardware and jump to boot code.

sys_info
--------
    "./uaputl.exe sys_info"

    This command returns system information such as firmware version number
    and HW information.

sys_reset
---------
    "./uaputl.exe sys_reset"

    This command is used to reset the Micro AP back to its initial state.
    For example, this can be used to recover from a serious error, or before
    creating a new BSS.

    This command has the following effects:
        1. The WLAN hardware MAC is reset.
        2. All MIB variables are initialized to their respective default
           values.
        3. The firmware internal variables are reset to their respective
           default values.

            Get current 802.11n parameters

aggrpriotbl
-----------
        "./uaputl.exe aggrpriotbl <m0> <n0> <m1> <n1> ... <m7> <n7>"
        This command is used set/get the priority table for AMPDU/AMSDU traffic per tid.
	    This command can also be used to disable AMPDU/AMSDU for a given tid.
	    In case of AMPDU this priority table will be used to setup block ack (to make
	    sure the highest priority tid always uses AMPDU as we have limited AMPDU streams)
        
        The supported option are:
            <m0> <n0> <m1> <n1> ... <m7> <n7>

	    <mx> - This is priority for Tid0 for AMPDU packet. A priority could be any 
                values between 0 - 7, 0xff to disable aggregation.
	    <nx> - This is priority for Tid0 for AMSDU packet. A priority could be any 
		        values between 0 - 7, 0xff to disable aggregation. 
        
        empty - Get current priority table for AMPDU/AMSDU traffic.
        
        Example:
        ./uaputl.exe aggrpriotbl  
            This command will get the current Priority table for AMPDU and AMSDU.
			<2 2 0 0 1 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 255 255 255 255>. This is read as
			<"Prio for AMPDU for Tid0" "Prio for AMSDU for Tid0" 
			"Prio for AMPDU for Tid1" "Prio for AMSDU for Tid1" and so on

	    ./uaputl.exe aggrpriotbl 2 2 0 0 1 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 255 255 255 255 
            This will set the priority table for AMPDU and AMSDU
			Priority for Tid0/AMPDU = 2, Tid0/AMSDU = 2, Tid1/AMPDU = 0, Tid1/AMSDU = 0
			and so on. Aggregation for Tid6 and Tid7 are disabled. 
			Here higher the priority number, higher the priority (i.e. 7 
			has higher priority than 6). Similarly for AMSDU.

	    ./uaputl.exe aggrpriotbl 0xff 2 0xff 0 0xff 1 0xff 3 0xff 4 0xff 5 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 
            This will disable AMPDU for all the TIDs but will still keep AMSDU enabled to Tid0 to Tid5

	    The default setting is 2 255 0 255 1 255 3 255 4 255 5 255 255 255 255 255.

	    A delBA should be seen in case a disable happens on a TID for which AMPDU stream 
	        is currently setup. 

        Note:- This command should only be issued in disconnected state.

addbareject
-----------
        "./uaputl.exe addbareject <m0> <m1> ... <m7>"
        This command is used set/get the addbareject table for all the TIDs.
	    This command can also be used to enable rejection of ADDBA requests for a given tid.

        The supported option are:
            <m0> <m1> ... <m7>
        <mX> - This can be 0/1 for TidX. 1 enables rejection of ADDBA request for TidX and 
		   0 would accept any ADDBAs for TidX.
        empty - Get current addbareject table for all the TIDs.

        Example:
        ./uaputl.exe addbareject 
            This command will get the current table.
	        [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]. ADDBA would be accepted for all TIDs. This is the default state.

        ./uaputl.exe addbareject 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 
            This command will accept ADDBA requests for Tid [0,1,4,5,6,7] and reject ADDBA requests for Tid [2,3]
							
	    ./uaputl.exe addbareject 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
            This will enable rejection of ADDBA requests for all Tids.

        Note:- This command should only be issued in disconnected state.

txpwrlimit_cfg_get
txpwrlimit_2g_cfg_set
txpwrlimit_5g_cfg_set
------------------
    This command is used to set/get the configuration data of Tx power limitation.
    Note: The configuration set should be issued when no STA is connected.

    Examples:
        ./uaputl.exe hostcmd config/txpwrlimit_cfg.conf txpwrlimit_cfg_get
        ./uaputl.exe hostcmd config/txpwrlimit_cfg.conf txpwrlimit_2g_cfg_set
        ./uaputl.exe hostcmd config/txpwrlimit_cfg.conf txpwrlimit_5g_cfg_set

tx_data_pause
-------------
  "./uaputl.exe tx_data_pause [ENABLE][TX_BUF_CNT]"

    This command is used to set/get tx data pause settings.

    The supported option are:
        [ENABLE]: Enable/disable pause tx events from firmware to host. 
        [TX_BUF_CNT]: Max number of TX buffers allowed for all PS clients
        empty - Get current tx data pause settings
    
    Example:
    ./uaputl.exe tx_data_pause      : Display tx data pause settings
    ./uaputl.exe tx_data_pause 1    : Enable pause tx event, max tx buffer number unchanged.
    ./uaputl.exe tx_data_pause 0    : Disable pasue tx event, max tx buffer number unchanged.
    ./uaputl.exe tx_data_pause 1 22 : Enable pause tx event, with max tx buffer number 22.

        U S E R  M A N U A L  F O R  IWPRIV

NAME
	This manual describes the usage of private commands used in Marvell MLAN
	Linux UAP Driver.

	To use parameters as hex format, a '0x' must precede it for the parameters to 
	be parsed properly.

SYNOPSIS
	iwpriv <uapX> <command> [sub-command] ...

	iwpriv uapX version
	iwpriv uapX verext
	iwpriv uapX start
	iwpriv uapX stop
	iwpriv uapX bssstart
	iwpriv uapX bssstop
	iwpriv uapX fwreload <path>
	iwpriv uapX apcfg "ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG,SSID=TEST_uAP,[SEC,][KEY,]
	                   [CHANNEL,][PREAMBLE,][MAX_SCB,][END]"

DESCRIPTION
	Those commands are used to send additional commands to the Marvell MLAN
	card via the Linux device driver.

	The uapX parameter specifies the network device that is to be used to 
	perform this command on. It could be uap0, uap1 etc.

version	
	This is used to get the current version of the driver and the firmware.

verext
	Retrieve and display an extended version string from the firmware

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX verext [#]

	where [#] is an optional argument to retrieve a specific version string,
	omission of the argument retrieves the 0 indexed string.

start
	Start the uAP driver.

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX start

stop
	Stop the uAP driver.

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX stop

bssstart
	Start the AP mode, so that uAP will start transmitting beacon.

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX bssstart

bssstop
	Stop the AP mode and disconnect all stations. uAP will stop
	transmitting beacon as well.

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX bssstop

fwreload
	Reload the firmware. Here string "FW_PATH=" in the path
	argument is mandatory part.

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX fwreload <path>

apcfg
	This command is used to set the AP configurations. Here string
	"ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG" is minimum requirement in the ASCII string.
	Note: BSS will be stopped then restarted if BSS is already started 
	when the command is received.

	Usage:
		iwpriv uapX apcfg "ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG,SSID=TEST_uAP,[SEC=sec,]
			[KEY=key,][CHANNEL=channel,][MAX_SCB=max_scb,][END]"

	Where the parameters are:
		SSID:       Set SSID to be used in beacon and probe response
		[SEC]:      Security modes - open or wpa2-psk
		[KEY]:      Encrypted key for WPA2-PSK, minimum 8 chars
		[CHANNEL]:  Channel to be selected
		[MAX_SCB]:  Maximum STA number
		[END]:      Optional termination in ASCII string

	Examples:
		iwpriv uap0 apcfg "ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG,SSID=TEST_uAP"
                                        : Set AP SSID to "TEST_uAP"
		iwpriv uap0 apcfg "ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG,SSID=TEST_uAP,SEC=open"
                                        : Set AP SSID to "TEST_uAP" and
                                          security mode is disabled
		iwpriv uap0 apcfg "ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG,SSID=TEST_uAP,SEC=WPA2-PSK,KEY=ecbe5facdbfe234a"
                                        : Set AP SSID to "TEST_uAP" and security mode
                                          to WPA2-SPK and encrypted key ecbe5facdbfe234a
		iwpriv uap0 apcfg "ASCII_CMD=AP_CFG,SSID=TEST_uAP,CHANNEL=8"
                                        : Set AP SSID to "TEST_uAP" and
                                          set the AP channel to 8
